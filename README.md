C Code for live monitoring of the water level in overhead tanks based on 8051 circuitry with ultrasonic sensor, LCD, LEDs, and DS1307 RTC. It was written as a project in Keil and uses the Microchip AT89C51 library.

Components required :
1. 1 x 8051 MCU(any manufacturer, I have used the one by ATMEL)
2. 1 x Basic 8051 Circuitry(you can make one using a few components which I have mentioned in the last or can even use a ready to use 8051 development board)
3. 1 x Waterproof Ultrasonic sensor with its sensor module(I used teh HCSR04 unit)
4. 1 x LCD(I used the 16x2 LCD display)
5. 1 x DS1307 RTC
6. 7 x LED(better if of diiferent colours each)

Components required for making the 8051 basic circuit :
1. 1 x 10uF/16V Electrolytic capacitor
2. 2 x 33pF Ceramic capacitor
3. 1 x 10K Resistor
